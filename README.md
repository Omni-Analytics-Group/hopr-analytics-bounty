# HOPR Social Media Metrics Bounty

This R repository is our submission to the HOPR Analytics Bounty posted on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/issue/hoprnet/hopr-analytics/15/100025742). Here we compute various statistics to help HOPR better understand engagement within their Telegram and Twitter marketing channels in accordance with their goal that "external contributors pick up and work on the analytics of HOPR tokens."
